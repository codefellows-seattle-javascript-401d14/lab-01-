<p> Passed by reference means that the caller and the callee use the same variable for the parameter. This usually happens with objects, functions, and regular expressions. In other words, it points to the same place.</p>

<p> Passed by value means when the caller and the callee have two independent variables with the same value. This usually refers to numbers, booleans, and strings. In other words, it gets copied.</p>
