## description

Created a greet and arithmetic file in the library folders. Greet checks to see if the item presented is a string and returns null if isn't. Arithmetic performs addition and subtraction. It initially checks to see if the items being used are actually numbers. If they aren't it will return a request to enter number values. Tests for both arithmetic and greet were added to the test folders. Two tests are run for greet (one for a string and one for a non-string). Four tests are run for arithmetic (two have number values the other two do not).
